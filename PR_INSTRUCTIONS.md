## 🔧 Fixes Critical Referral Page Issues

This PR resolves the issue where some users couldn't see their referral data by fixing authentication and user ID logic bugs.

### 🔴 Issues Fixed:

1. **Authentication/Authorization Missing**: API endpoints had no validation - any user could access any other user's referral data
2. **User ID Logic Bug**: Frontend was overwriting actual user ID with referrer parameter 
3. **Poor Error Handling**: No proper validation for user existence or meaningful error messages
4. **Lack of Debugging Info**: No logging to troubleshoot issues

### ✅ Changes Made:

**Backend (`server.js`):**
- Added `validateTelegramUser` middleware for authentication
- Applied validation to `/api/referral-stats/:userId` and `/api/withdrawal-history/:userId`
- Added user existence validation with proper 404 responses
- Enhanced error logging and debugging info

**Frontend (`public/referral.html`):**
- Fixed user ID determination logic to prevent overwriting with referrer ID
- Added proper error handling for 403/404 responses  
- Added user ID validation before API calls
- Improved console logging for debugging

**Documentation:**
- Added `REFERRAL_FIXES.md` with detailed analysis and fix explanations

### 🧪 Testing:
- ✅ Valid users can access their own data
- ✅ Unauthorized access returns 403
- ✅ Non-existent users return 404
- ✅ Users with no referrals show empty state correctly
- ✅ Enhanced logging helps with debugging

### 🔒 Security Improvements:
- Prevents unauthorized access to other users' referral data
- Validates Telegram user identity before data access
- Proper error messages without data leakage

Fixes the core issue where referral data wasn't loading for some users due to authentication bypass and user ID confusion.
